# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview
This project implements a command-line based Tic Tac Toe game in Python. It allows two players to play the classic game on a 3x3 grid.

## Features
- Interactive gameplay between two players.
- Simple ASCII representation of the game board.
- Checks for win condition and declares the winner.
- Handles invalid moves and prompts for re-entry.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
   cd tic-tac-toe
   

2. Run the game:
   bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   

## Gameplay
- The game starts with Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) taking turns to place their marks on the board.
- Players enter their moves by specifying the row and column (e.g., `1 1` for the top-left corner).
- The game checks for win conditions after each move and announces the winner or declares a draw when the board is full.

## Project Structure
- `tic_tac_toe.py`: Main Python script containing the game logic.
